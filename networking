Services discovery via DNS (if external service needed it needs to be added into this DNS discovery as well)
	selectorless discovery:
		no selector > no pod assigned. Creating endpoints with same name as service with external ip = reachability for pod
	CNAME based kubernetes service:
		external DNS record is held, anyway DNS resolver needs to be added if classic google resolver doesnt know that (internal DNS)
