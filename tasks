1) create pod "myfirstpod" which will print hello every 10sec to stdout. Run it in namespace basic. Check your results with "kubectl logs" command

2) install multus CNI and deploy pod using this multus with more interfaces.

3) crate pod "multus-test" which will have more than one interface for pod. (you have to create network-attachment-definition first, all is available on multus pages)

4) create deployment "webserver" with 2 replicas and 2 containers in namespace "steborice": first container with  nginx image name "first", second with busybox image name "second".
Share volume "html" to those two containers. Make sure for "first" container mount point is "/usr/share/nginx/html". "second" mount point for this volume is /html
"second" container should write "'Everything is working fine! Good Job! <br />' $(date) '<br /> <br />'" to /html/index.html every 60 seconds
Create service for this deployment, type NodePort and check your results via curl and via chrome
